## List
The _List_ section provides an overview of all your registered users, their status and their roles. You can create new users or edit existing ones. Users can be sorted by name or their e-mail address by clicking on the corresponding table heading in the overview. The active sorting parameter is highlighted with an arrow icon.

If you click on the **Roles** parameter in the table heading, you can sort users by their roles or respectively by their status, if you click on the **Status** parameter. By clicking the colored circle icon in the *Status* column, you toggle the status from enabled to disabled. The colors represent the user status as follows.

Color | User Status
------|------
Green | User is enabled and can log in. If an enabled user can't log in, make sure they are assigned to a *Role* that is allowed to access the admin area.
Red   | The user is disabled and can't log in, no matter what role they belong to.
Blue  | This is a new user account and the user is enabled.

### Add and edit users
