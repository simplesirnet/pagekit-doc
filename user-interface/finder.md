# Finder

<p class="uk-article-lead">The _Finder_ is simple file manager to organize your media and upload new files, used for the [Storage](site.md#storage) section of the Pagekit administration.</p>

In the top left hand corner you can see how many files are currently uploaded to your site and search the storage. In the top right hand corner you can toggle between list or thumbnail view, create a new folder or upload files into the Finder. Simply drag and drop from your local file explorer or hit the _Upload_ button.

Next to each item there's a checkbox. Enabling the checkbox will display a toolbar that allows you to rename or delete the file or directory. The list view also displays information on the size and modify date of all files.
