## Overview

The Pagekit Editor supports HTML as well the the popular [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). The included auto-completion will adapt to the activated language. To toggle Markdown, just click the checkbox below the editor. You can also include HTML snippets in Markdown. 

Above the content area, you'll find a toolbar with the most frequent formatting tasks. Select text styles, insert links, quotes, lists and media elements. Depending on the current editor mode, the toolbar will automatically insert HTML or Markdown snippets.

In the top right hand corner you can see an arrow icon to enter **full screen mode**. If you are on a large enough screen, you will see a side by side view of your content source on the left and the rendered preview on the right. On smaller devices, this will be displayed in two separate tabs.

## Images
To insert an image, just click the _image_ icon and a modal will appear where you can choose a picture from _Storage_. When the Storage dialog is open, you can also drag and drop the desired image file from your local file browser. Once an image is selected, click the update button and the image shortcode will appear in the current cursor position.

**Note** You can always open the dialog again by placing the cursor inside the shortcode and clicking on the toolbar icon.

## Videos
As with images, inserting a video is as simple as clicking the _video_ icon and using the modal dialog.

## Links
To insert a link, select the text you want to link and click on the _link_ icon from the toolbar. You can also insert an link without selecting any text in which case the title will be used as the link text.

## Text Editing
The remaining toolbar icons are for other frequent text editing tasks. Just select the text to be edited and click on the desired icon to apply its style.
