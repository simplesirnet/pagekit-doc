# Getting Help
<p class="uk-article-lead">There are several channels to reach the developers and the Pagekit community to get direct assistance.</p>

If you can't find the right answers to your questions, you can turn to one of our other sources to get help and discuss your issues, but also to receive news and update notifications.

## Gitter

Once done, you can access the chat at [https://gitter.im/pagekit/pagekit](https://gitter.im/pagekit/pagekit) or you can download one of the available [Gitter apps](https://gitter.im/apps).
